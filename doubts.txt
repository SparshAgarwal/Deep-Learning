Q.Lab Report for Lab 2.I'm a bit confusing about what to put in the lab report. The slide says only focus on experimental result and discussion,
but I'm not sure other than accuracy measure for different number of hidden units and error vs epoch plot, what else should I put into the report?
    A. Make one plot for each number of HUs.
    On each plot have three curves. One for train, one for tune, one for test
    There is a stylized plot like in the lecture notes

Q.What loss function should I use for lab 1 and 2? Do I just choose whatever loss function I want?
    Use squared error (plus the sum of squared weights if you do weight decay).

Q.When I use step function as activation function, the training error of my program does not stably decrease at each training iterations. After some iterations, the training error may jump from 15% to 40%.
  I tried sigmoid function and linear function, these worked fine.
    Yes, that was the sort of oscillating results we got in my cs540 last term.  It is a mystery as to why.  I fixed it by using an ensemble.  Nice to know other activation functions work better.
    Did you include the derivative of the sigmoid?  According to the calculation of the backprop algo you should, though it might work to ignore it.  The linear function has a derivative of 1, so it is 'included' automatically.
