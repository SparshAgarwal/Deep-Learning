// The structure of this dataset is described below.
// (we're using a very restricted design for simplicity).

// You can visit
//    http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thoracic+Surgery+Data
// to see more about this dataset.

// NOTE: Your code should handle both Windows-formatted and Linux-formatted files
// (which, unfortunately, differ in how the end of line is represented).

// Your code should HANDLE ANY AMOUNT OF 'white space,' including blank lines, BETWEEN TOKENS.

// Note that you only need to handle '//' comments (ie, there will be no "/* */" comments.
// It is easy in Java to the contents of a string BEFORE any '//' (might get the empty string,
// which should also be ignored).

// The number of features:
31

// Next are the feature names followed by a dash and then the legal values of this feature
// In the CS 540 programming HWs related to decision trees, we will assume that all features have
// two possible values, though they might have names other than the T and F used here (eg,
// might have: "size - small big" in some other testbed used during grading).

// Converted DGN from ONE feature with SEVEN legal values to SEVEN Boolean-valued features.

// HOWEVER used 2.0 as the lower threshold since mean - stdDev was less than the minimum value.

// Converted PRE6 (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_status#ECOG.2FWHO.2FZubrod_score)
// to a 'thermometer scale' (explained in class)/  Ie, PRZ2 = T T, PRZ1 = T F, and PRZ0 = F F (not sure why Wikepedia lists FIVE, though 'death' would be give away).

// The class labels (unless stated otherwise, we assume for cs540 HWs, for simplicity, that only TWO values are possible):
lived
died

// The original fields, copied verbatim from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Thoracic+Surgery+Data
//  1. DGN: Diagnosis - specific combination of ICD-10 codes for primary and secondary as well multiple tumours if any (DGN3,DGN2,DGN4,DGN6,DGN5,DGN8,DGN1)
//  2. PRE4: Forced vital capacity - FVC (numeric)
//  3. PRE5: Volume that has been exhaled at the end of the first second of forced expiration - FEV1 (numeric)
//  4. PRE6: Performance status - Zubrod scale (PRZ2,PRZ1,PRZ0)
//  5. PRE7: Pain before surgery (T,F)
//  6. PRE8: Haemoptysis before surgery (T,F)
//  7. PRE9: Dyspnoea before surgery (T,F)
//  8. PRE10: Cough before surgery (T,F)
//  9. PRE11: Weakness before surgery (T,F)
// 10. PRE14: T in clinical TNM - size of the original tumour, from OC11 (smallest) to OC14 (largest) (OC11,OC14,OC12,OC13)
// 11. PRE17: Type 2 DM - diabetes mellitus (T,F)
// 12. PRE19: MI up to 6 months (T,F)
// 13. PRE25: PAD - peripheral arterial diseases (T,F)
// 14. PRE30: Smoking (T,F)
// 15. PRE32: Asthma (T,F)
// 16. AGE: Age at surgery (numeric)
// 17. Risk1Y: 1 year survival period - (T)rue value if died (T,F) 


/////////////////////////////

// The number of examples (will read this many in; ok to have more in the file)
90

// The examples (as mentioned above, we assume, for simplicity, that all features are BOOLEAN-VALUED, 
// *though the names of the two values might differ across datasets*)

//   First is the example's name, then its category, finally followed
//   by the values of all of its features (listed in the order of the
//   feature names above, will be separated by "whitespace"). 
//   The (boring) names are simply used to concisely identify the examples.
//   Your decision-tree learner should NOT use these names as a feature (what would happen if you did?).
