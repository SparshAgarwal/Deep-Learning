// Data from Professor Shavlik's CS CS540 (UW-Madison)
// The structure of a dataset will be as described below.
// (we're using a very restricted design for simplicity).

// The number of features:
4

// The names of the features (attributes describing the person aboard the
// Titanic when it sank):
type - passenger crew
accomodations - regular luxury
age - adult child
gender - male female

// The class labels (we assume, for simplicity, that only TWO values are 
// possible): Whether or not the person in question died on the Titanic
survived
died

// The number of examples (will read this many in; ok to have more in the file)
30

// The examples (we assume, for simplicity, that all features are 
// BINARY-VALUED)
//   First is the example's name, then its category, finally followed
//   by the values of all of its features (listed in the order of the
//   feature names above, will be separated by "whitespace"). 
//   The (boring) names are simply used to concisely identify the examples
//   (eg, during debugging).

// You may assume that the feature values are only the ones specified above
// (ie, we will not be checking if you handle illegal input files).
